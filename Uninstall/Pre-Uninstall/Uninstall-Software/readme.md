## DESCRIPTION
This script is useful if you need to uninstall software before installing or updating other software. 

Typically best used as a pre-script in most situations.

One example use case of this script with Patch My PC's Publisher is if you have previously re-packaged software installed
on your devices and you need to uninstall the repackaged software, and install using the vendor's native install media 
(provided by the Patch My PC catalogue).

The script searches the registry for installed software, matching the supplied DisplayName value in the -DisplayName parameter
with that of the DisplayName in the registry.
If one match is found, it uninstalls the software using the QuietUninstallString or UninstallString.

You can supply additional arguments to the uninstaller using the -AdditionalArguments, -AdditionalMSIArguments, or -AdditionalEXEArguments parameters.

You cannot use -AdditionalArguments with -AdditionalMSIArguments or -AdditionalEXEArguments.

If a product code is not in the UninstallString, QuietUninstallString or UninstallString are used.
QuietUninstallString is preferred if it exists.

If more than one matches of the DisplayName occurs, uninstall is not possible unless you use the -UninstallAll switch.

If QuietUninstallString and UninstallString is not present or null, uninstall is not possible.

A log file is created in the temp directory with the name "Uninstall-Software-\<DisplayName\>.log" which contains the verbose output of the script.

An .msi log file is created in the temp directory with the name "\<DisplayName\>_\<DisplayVersion\>.msi.log" which contains the verbose output of the msiexec.exe process.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Uninstall-Software.ps1 -DisplayName "Greenshot"
```

Uninstalls Greenshot if "Greenshot" is detected as the DisplayName in a key under either of the registry key paths:

- SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
- SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

### EXAMPLE 2
```
Uninstall-Software.ps1 -DisplayName "Mozilla*"
```

Uninstalls any products where DisplayName starts with "Mozilla"

### EXAMPLE 3
```
Uninstall-Software.ps1 -DisplayName "*SomeSoftware*" -AdditionalMSIArguments "/quiet /norestart" -AdditionalEXEArguments "/S" -UninstallAll
```

Uninstalls all software where DisplayName contains "SomeSoftware". 

For any software found in the registry matching the search criteria and are MSI-based (WindowsInstaller = 1), "/quiet /norestart" will be supplied to the uninstaller.

For any software found in the registry matching the search criteria and  are EXE-based (WindowsInstaller = 0 or non-existent), "/S" will be supplied to the uninstaller.

### EXAMPLE 4
```
Uninstall-Software.ps1 -DisplayName "KiCad*" -ProcessName "Un_A"
```

Uninstalls KiCad and waits for the process "Un_A" to finish after the uninstallation has started.

### EXAMPLE 5
```
Uninstall-Software.ps1 -DisplayName "SomeSoftware" -VersionGreaterThan 1.0.0
```

Uninstalls SomeSoftware if the version is greater than 1.0.0

### EXAMPLE 6
```
Uninstall-Software.ps1 -DisplayName "AnyDesk" -EnforcedArguments "--remove --silent"
```

Uninstalls AnyDesk with the enforced arguments "--remove --silent", instead of using the default parameters in the UninstallString.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -HivesToSearch

### -WindowsInstaller
Specify a value between 1 and 0 to use as an additional criteria when trying to find installed software.

If WindowsInstaller registry value has a data of 1, it generally means software was installed from MSI.

Omitting the parameter entirely or specify a value of 0 generally means software was installed from EXE

This is useful to be more specific about software titles you want to uninstall.

Specifying a value of 0 will look for software where WindowsInstaller is equal to 0, or not present at all.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 0
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SystemComponent
Specify a value between 1 and 0 to use as an additional criteria when trying to find installed software.

Specifying a value of 0 will look for software where SystemComponent is equal to 0, or not present at all.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 0
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

This parameter can be used in conjuction with -VersionEqualTo and -VersionGreaterThan.

```yaml
Type: Version
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -VersionEqualTo
